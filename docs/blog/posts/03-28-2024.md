# Cloudformation 

I've been trying to setup a purely AWS based Data Engineering curriculum that folks can use to learn AWS in the DE space as I did not find anything myself.

For one the first projects, I planned to use the NYC Taxi Cab data set in CSV format, drop them in an S3 bucket, use a Lambda function to convert them to parquet and store them in a separate bucket.

The following resources are required.
 - Incoming S3 Bucket
 - Output S3 Bucket (that will contain the parquet files)
 - an SQS queue 
 - Lambda Function

 The SQS acts as a landing zone for all S3 Event triggers that gets created everytime an object is added to the incoming S3 bucket. Why is there a need for an SQS you may ask? We can always have S3 Event triggers act as direct triggers for a Lambda function to execute. Well, in the event of a failed S3 event (yes it is an event pun!), we either have to write logic to ensure that the Lambda function adds all the information of the failed S3 event and write it into a queue anyway that can be processed later. We are solving this by adding an SQS layer instead.

 Visually, what we are trying to do is, instead of

Option 1:  CSV File added to S3 bucket --> S3 Event Created --> Lambda Trigger to process CSV file

 is 

Option 2:  CSV File added to S3 Bucket --> S3 Event Created --> SQS --> Lambda Trigger to process CSV file.

Option 2 is a better architected solution than Option 1. As to why, i leave that as an exercise to the reader.
